The PIC IDE changes the project files frequently even when there are no significant changes.

The actual files are not tracked by Git for that reason.

A good copy of the project files should be kept in this directory and updated occasionally to
make sure that they are fresh.

These copies allow updates to be passed between project members.  They will be
retrieved when a new repository is created or when pulled from a public repository.
They should then be copied to the parent directory for use in the project.
